What is a remote repository?

The remote repository is a version or storage of some project that is hosted somewhere on the internet. For example, github uses remote repositories in order to enable easier collaboration on projects. These repositories are considered remote because rather than being hosted on your own local computer, it is hosted on github's computers.
