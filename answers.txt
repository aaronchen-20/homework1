What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

<<<<<<< HEAD
The difference between a merge and a rebase on git is that merge appends the changes into a file in addition to the original file, while rebase will actually end up replacing the file.
=======
The remote repository is a version or storage of some project that is hosted somewhere on the internet. For example, github uses remote repositories in order to enable easier collaboration on projects. These repositories are considered remote because rather than being hosted on your own local computer, it is hosted on github's computers.
